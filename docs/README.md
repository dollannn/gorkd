## Decisions

Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) live in [decisions/](decisions/).

When we make a significant technical choice, we document:
- **Context**: What prompted the decision
- **Decision**: What we chose
- **Consequences**: Trade-offs accepted

See [ADR Process](decisions/0001-adr-process.md) for the template and rules.
